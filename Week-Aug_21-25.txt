Monday: 
  Todo: 
    - Patch Lower Environments prior to Cab. 

  Sidebar:
    - Can I grab Gavin for 5 minues after the standup. 
        Can I add a specific version to a package or will the update script run and grab the latest sec patches?

      - Cancelled (CAB-4221) for review on Monday. ( Package issue might be a sidebar )

    - Found the quicksight access issue and solved for Brady (SYS-18960)
      - Paired with Abdel to show changes to Documentation and fixed Brady right after. 

    - Postponed CAB-4220 due to missing plan
      - Spent the remainder of the day trying to install yaml on pyenv 2.7.18
